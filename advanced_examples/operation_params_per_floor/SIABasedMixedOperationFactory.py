    This operation parameters factory does assign different operation profiles for different floors of the building.
    SHOP is used for all groundfloor's of the buildings and MFH for all other floors.
    The CESAR-P data model and IDF generation process supports assigning different operational profile for each floor, but
    The cesar-p-core package has no function to actually make use of that possibility, so you need to implement your own
    operation parameters factory as demonstrated here if you want to do so.

    The operational factory has to implement cesarp.manager.manager_protocols.BuildingOperationFactoryProtocol
    The __init__ method needs to have the same attributes as src.cesarp.operation.fixed.FixedBuildingOperationFactory.FixedBuildingOperationFactory.__init__
    The factory is instantiated in cesarp.manager.BldgModelFactory.BldgModelFactory.__create_bldg_operation_factory depending on config.
