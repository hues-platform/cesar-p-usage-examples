"""
This example does demonstrate how you can run multiple scenarios without re-generating the building models from scratch,
but just change some attributes. This is helpful especially if you are using variable profile and you want to keep
the assignment constant over different runs. Some things, as the geometry can only be changed when fully re-creating, 
which you can do with the create_scenario() method of ProjectManager. But keep in mind that with this you do not 
have consistent assignment of profiles in case you use variability.


Limitations of this approach:

- Note that for chaning heating or cooling setpoint you have to generate new operational profils, e.g. based on SIA2024 and 
  edit the heating/cooling setpoint in the input excel data sheet.

- You can theoretically do retrofitting with this approach, however there is a more sophisticated pipeline including a log which
  enables e.g. to track emissions and costs

- If you have the same weather file for the whole site, but you want to do several runs with a different weather file
  a even more custom approach to re-run the IDF to avoid copying too much data without significant information gain is better.
