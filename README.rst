=====================================
Example usage scripts for CESAR-P
=====================================

Collection of scripts to use the cesar-p-core library. 
Different usage scenarios are shown here, but it does not include all possibilities.

The project is NOT intended to be directly used to start your project.
Copy and paste the scripts you want to use to your project and adapt to your needs.

Project Info
============
- Main contact: Kristina Orehounig
- Developers: LÃ©onie Fierz (Urban Energy Systems Lab at Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology Empa)
- Programming Language and Version: Python 3.8 
- Dependencies (see also requirements.txt)

  - cesar-p version 2.4.0
  - geomeppy (for 3D obj generation from idf files, needed for 3dview.py example)

- Documentation: all included in this README and in the comments of the different example scripts

Project Status
===============

There is no versioning for this examples project, but they are ready to be used as a start for your own project based on cesar-p-core.
There are Tags marking the version compatible with earlier cesar-p-core lib versions in case you need to use an older cesar-p-core version.

Installation & Usage
=====================

1. Set up [cesar-p-core library](https://github.com/hues-platform/cesar-p-core) according to the [installation guide](https://cesar-p-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#installation-usage)

2. Activate the virtual environment you installed cesar-p-core libarary, if you followed the installation instrucctions and you are on Windows do:

    .. code-block::

      %USERPROFILE%/venv-cesar-p/Scripts/activate

3. Open a shell and navigate to the folder you want to have the examples in. 

4. Clone this project to your computer: 

  .. code-block::
     
      git clone https://github.com/hues-platform/cesar-p-usage-examples

5. Then to run e.g. the simple example:

  ..  code-block::

      cd simple_example
      python simple_run.py

  You can adapt the simple_example/simple_main_config.yml to point to your project files for site vertices, building information and weather file.

For more options what you can do with the SimulationManager API, e.g. hourly result outputs, check out *advanced_examples/basic_cesar_usage.py*

For more information about CESAR-P usage please refer to CESAR-P core project https://github.com/hues-platform/cesar-p-core

For instructions how to run CESAR-P with Docker: see Dockerfile and instruction in cesar-p-core repository https://github.com/hues-platform/cesar-p-core


Scripts overview
=================

For most of the examples in *pre_or_postprocessing_scripts* you need to first run a simulation of the *simple_example* project, see above.
Navigate to *pre_or_postprocessing_scripts* to run the scripts, as most of them have relative path specifications.

A short overview of the examples included:
