"""
Does parse a site vertices file (csv) and counts the number of vertices per building.
Might be useful to check your building geometries and to find building with many vertices, 
which will be slow to simulate. Their footprints might be made less complex without loosing
much accuracy. Note that cesar-p support up to 250 vertices (limiting is the IDD respectively eppy)

Run simple example prior to run this script or adapt pathes to your project.
